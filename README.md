# PythonPractice_OOIS
A record of all practice exercises done while learning Python for the second module of the PGCert in Computer Science at University of Essex Online: Object Oriented Information Systems.

These files show all practice exercises completed throughout the course, organised into separate folders. These will serve as a reference for me in future to assist in the further development of my programming experience and knowledge. 
They will also serve as evidence for my e-portfolio.
